## What We Do

CrOSSploit is a small but focused ChromeOS security research group dedicated to exploring,
understanding, and responsibly abusing design flaws in ChromeOS management and restriction systems.

### Our focus areas include:

- **Stopping Internet Censorship**  
  We research vulnerabilities and exploits that disable enrollment and poorly designed
  internet filters / blockers on Chromebooks.

- **Utility Development**  
  We build scripts and tools that make modifying a Chromebook as easy as possible.
  no unnecessary complexity, no hand-holding nonsense.
